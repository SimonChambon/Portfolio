            <div class="aboutText">
            <p>Curious by nature, I first spent most of my life experimenting with creativity through various lenses until I recently decided to focus on studying and learning programming languages. I've joined <a href="https://www.cf2m.be/" target="_blank"> the CF2M team </a>last April for this specific purpose ; a very nice school with lovely comrades and devoted teachers, located in my neighborhood.<br>
            This website has been made as part of my studies ; to try and exercise new skills I've learned, to show works I've done, and also, to share ideas I like or inspiring influences that help my daily practice. This has not been entirely completed for now, but it will be updated as the work progresses. </p>

            <p>In short, and in conclusion, I have to say that I really appreciate your being here looking at my very first steps towards the fascinating world of web development. But well... Please be indulgent, we all must start somewhere!</p>
