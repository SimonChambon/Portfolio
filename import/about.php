<article id="about">
            <p>Hi! I'm a 32 years old budding coder based in Brussels, Belgium, and I really appreciate your being here looking at my first very steps towards the fascinating world of web development. Please be indulgent, we all must start somewhere!</p>

            <p>This website has been made as part of my studies ; to try and exercise new skills I've learned, to show works I've done, and also share ideas I like, inspiring influences that help my daily practice.</p>

            <p>Curious by nature, I spent most of my life exploring and experimenting with creativity through various lenses. My high attention to detail allows me to connect the dots and improve experiences.</p>
